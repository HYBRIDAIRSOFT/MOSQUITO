# MOSQUITO Open Beta Test
This repository contains STEP and STL files for the open beta 1 test of the MOSQUITO airsoft kit created by HYBRID AIRSOFT.

The MOSQUITO is an open-source, modular, 3D-printed airsoft kit designed to take a V3 gearbox and hop-up chamber from a TM-based AK platform and turn them into a pure menacing machine on the airsoft battlefield, being super compact and lightweight with the same fire power as any other gun.
